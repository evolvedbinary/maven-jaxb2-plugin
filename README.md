* **Supports JAXB 2 and JAXB 3.**

## Provenance
This is a fork of the JAXB2 Maven Plugin from [phax/maven-jaxb2-plugin](https://github.com/phax/maven-jaxb2-plugin),
which is itself a fork on [highsource/maven-jaxb2-plugin](https://github.com/highsource/maven-jaxb2-plugin), and we suspect
that was itself a fork of the [javaee/metro-maven-jaxb2-plugin](https://github.com/javaee/metro-maven-jaxb2-plugin) which originated
from *java.net*.

The plugin from which this was forked has been commonly known as the: *"jvmnet JAXB2 Plugin"*.

The purpose of our fork is to add support for JAXB 3.

### Notes on Licensing
The forks from which this project came claim that it is licensed under a [BSD-2 Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license.
However, there is also evidence of Apache 2.0 licensed code within the project. The code in the original
*java.net* project appears instead to have been dual-licensed as [CDDL 1.1](https://spdx.org/licenses/CDDL-1.1.html) and [GPL 2 + Classpath Exception](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html) license.

Whilst we believe it is likely that this code is Open Source and resides under a mix of the above discussed licenses, the exact licensing of
the code remains murky at best. 

## Introduction

Welcome to the JAXB Maven Plugin, the most advanced and feature-full Maven plugin for XML Schema compilation.

This Maven plugin wraps and enhances the [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net/) [Schema Compiler (XJC)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html) and allows
compiling XML Schemas (as well as WSDL, DTDs, RELAX NG) into Java classes in Maven builds.

> If you are interested in the Mojohaus JAXB2 Maven Plugin (`org.codehaus.mojo:jaxb2-maven-plugin`),
> please follow [this link](https://github.com/mojohaus/jaxb2-maven-plugin) to the corresponding website.

## Quick start

* Put your schemas (`*.xsd`) and bindings (`*.xjb`) into the `src/main/resources` folder.
* Add the plugin to your `pom.xml`:

### For JAXB 3:
```xml
<project ...>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb30-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.15.0</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
```

### For JAXB 2:
Use: `<artifactId>jaxb2-maven-plugin</artifactId>` instead.

### JAXB Versions

If you need a specific JAXB version, you can explicitly use one of the following variants:

* `com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet:jaxb30-maven-plugin` - JAXB 3.0.
* `com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet:jaxb23-maven-plugin` - JAXB 2.3.
* `com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet:jaxb22-maven-plugin` - JAXB 2.2.
* `com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet:jaxb2-maven-plugin` - "latest 2.x version"; at the moment this is same as `com.evolvedbinary.maven.jvnet:jaxb23-maven-plugin`.

### Java versions

Supported Java versions are `1.8` and onwards.
